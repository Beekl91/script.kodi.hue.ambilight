script.kodi.hue.ambilight
=========================

A Kodi add-on that controls Philips Hue lights. In "Theater mode" the add-on dims the the Philips Hue lights as soon as a movie starts playing, and turns the lights back on once the movie is done. "Ambilight mode" turns your Philips Hue lights in a room-sized ambilight.

Support
-------
This is a side project for me, and as such I'll update it when and if I have time . I'll happily respond to issues and feature requests (provided that they are detailed enough to realistically debug your problem (**LOGS**)). Since this is based on @cees-elzinga's original work, I've only modified some of the functions to enhance the features. I don't personally use the ambilight feature, and therefore havent done much testing with it... Again, happy to try and help out, but don't expect super-quick responses!

Please fork and enhance! Pull requests welcome!

Debugging
---------
Please turn on Debug Logging through the addon (Configure -> Advanced Settings -> Debug Logging) and follow the procedure at http://kodi.wiki/view/Log_file/Easy to upload a log file. Provide a link to your logfile in the issue.

Installation
------------

The add-on depends on the Kodi add-on "requests" for the ambilight mode.

**Kodi add-on script.module.requests**

 - Download the add-on as a ZIP file from https://github.com/beenje/script.module.requests
  - (Click on the green "Clone or download button" then click on the "Download ZIP" link).
 - Open Kodi
 - Go to `System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file`
 - Select the zip file.

**Kodi add-on script.kodi.hue.ambilight**

 - Download the add-on as a ZIP file from the top of this page
  - (Click on the green "Clone or download button" then click on the "Download ZIP" link).
 - Open Kodi
 - Kodi 16 :
 - Go to `System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file`
 - Kodi 17 :
 - Go to `Extensions -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file`
 -  Restart Kodi and configure the add-on:
   - Kodi 16 :
   - `System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Enabled add-ons -> Services -> Kodi Philips Hue`
   - Kodi 17 :

   - Run `Start auto discovery of bridge IP and User`.

Note for Raspberry Pi users:

 - Save the add-on configuration by exiting Kodi before shutting down the Pi completely
 - Ambilight mode doesn't work on a Raspberry Pi due to the way it renders video
